[UPDATED!] Automatic Email Testing for WP plugin allows you to set up a system inside wordpress to test your email server every day. 

== Description ==

Automatic Email Testing for WP is an efficient solution to help you automatically check whether your website’s email sending is working as expected every single day.

Email sending is one of the most fundamental functionalities of your website. When your website is unable to send out emails, contact form enquiries fail to reach you, order emails fail to reach your customers, and the list just goes on.

By using Automatic Email Testing for WP plugin on your website, you will have a smart system that helps you to test your website email server automatically every day, so you can have the assurance that your website’s email sending functionality is working well, day in and out!

The setup process is incredibly quick and simple. All you need is to enter your email address (one-time) and you’re good to go!

The plugin will send the first test email to you immediately once your email address has been saved. Subsequently, it will automatically run tests on your website email server and you should receive a simple email testing report every 24 hours (approx.) if your website email server is working normally.

In the event that you do not receive the daily email testing report on any given day, it means that your website email server is down and you may refer to the plugin settings page for a quick guide on how to troubleshoot the issue.
